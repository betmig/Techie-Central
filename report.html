            <h2>Betmig Link</h2>
            <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>Web design is an essential aspect of marketing for any business and organization. A well-designed website can help you stand out from competitors and attract new customers. However, knowing where to start when designing a website can be difficult. Lucky for me, I've been taking a class in Web Development and was assigned the task of creating a newsletter website with the tools I learned during the semester. Since I'm studying Computer Science, I need to improve my current skills and develop and build great websites so companies and the community can benefit from them. </p>
                <p>In the web-development module, we learned how to design websites by learning design principles, prototyping, wireframing, programming languages like Javascript, and markup language like HTML5 and CSS3, which styles it. </p>
                <p>I struggled a lot trying to pick up a theme and ultimately decided to do one of my favorite topics, which is Engineering itself. I wanted to create a general-purpose newsletter website where engineers and engineers to be could collaborate and grow together. Initially, I tried to do a "Women in Engineering" newsletter website. Still, I decided to make it more inclusive and broaden my audience to include everyone of all genders and sexual expressions, from young to old. Everyone welcome! </p>
                <p>This idea made encouraged me to brainstorm a lot, and I found myself imagining how I could build this community and what could be their needs and interests. </p>
                <p>I have joined many online tech communities before, and currently I lead a Google Developer Groups in West Virginia, USA - where I live. I enjoy collaborating with the community, but sometimes these communities lack a lot of resources, or it isn't effortless to get full circle when you want to collaborate with other engineers. I isolated some pain points from these other websites and focused on fulfilling those needs and that's how I created the main structure of my website. </p>
                <p>My website needed a cute logo, accessibility buttons to make it inclusive, and an inspiring section where people could share inspiring videos. I love watching these types of videos when I am stuck in a hard bug, it usually helps me to unwind, and after 10 minutes of watching this video, I typically have the answer to the issue. Distracting yourself slightly with something positive that can help you grow can sometimes unblock you. </p>
                <p>I also created an area where you can learn new skills. In this section, people can learn by watching these videos that YouTube hosts, and you also get access to third-party resources. It is super important that software engineers share knowledge with each other, and it is expected that you will be learning something new constantly since frameworks change fast and complexity increases non-stop. You can't just do this if you want to stay relevant in this industry, so there was a need to create this section. </p>
                <p>The following section is the Collab section, where you can get a short article/tutorial that teaches you how to collaborate with others engineers. It goes over what kind of technologies to use and how your approach should be when collaborating with people of different skill levels. Another important aspect of this section is the mentor/mentee opportunity and it encourages the community to create these opportunities with each-other. </p>
                <p>Finally, we have the Events section. There's a cliche that Software Engineers are introverts. That seems to be mostly the case, so I wanted to encourage healthy socialization between peers by inviting them to Events, Parties, Hackathons, Code Reviews, Pair Programming, etc. We leverage a different platform (meetup.com) to announce and share these events with interested people. </p>
                <p>Also, let's not forget the primary purpose of this website is to be a newsletter. In the News section, you'll be able to access the most recent news from different sources and also in-house articles by Techie Central staff (just me, but let me dream for now). </p>
                <p>Overall, I had a lot of fun making this, but I am a little sore from this intense exercise. I hope you enjoy my experience on how I learned to doodle with code, and now I can draw coherent images that hopefully will get my teacher's thumbs up. </p>
                </p>
            <h1>Inspiration</h1>
                <p>To start my website, I needed to get some inspiration. As I said, in the beginning, I was aiming to make a website just for Women, so I researched the following newsletter websites:</p>
                <p>50intech.com[1]</p>
                <p>This website has a newsletter, and you can also find a job board, resources, and much more. Nice and bright colors, still a very professional look. Business like blue, electric neons for highlights in white background.</p>
                <p>adaslist.co</p>
                <p>A similar type of website as 50intech.com. Nice color choice, minty and fresh.</p>
                <p>elpha.com</p>
                <p>A similar type of website as 50intech.com. Minty and fresh. Typography is feminine.</p>
                <p>latinasintech.org</p>
                <p>Similar type of website as 50intech.com. Very identical to elpha and adalist, green is the color of choice. </p>
                <p>women-in-tech.org</p>
                <p>Similar type of website as 50intech.com. Color pallet seems like a mix between 50intech and elpha.</p>
                <p>After getting bored with these designs, I looked into other websites like hackernoon.com, which has a much better design and higher quality articles. I decided to go with something like this but keep it balanced with a straightforward but slick design.</p>
                <p>I also like the color purple and wanted to make my website accessibility-friendly, so I couldn't get too crazy with the colors. I decided to go simple and keep the palette with the colors purple, white, grey, black, and hot pink.</p>
            <h1>Accessibility</h1>
                <p>To make my website accessible, I ensured the end-user could modify font size as needed. Also, they can switch between light and dark mode by accessing the accessibility tools menu on the top right.</p>
                <p>Another way I made my website accessible is by using semantic HTML tags in the appropriate places. I did this with the header, nav, and article tags. </p>
                <p>I also added alt tags on all the images displayed on my website, so a reader can read them to someone who is visually impaired.</p>
            <h1>Usability</h1>
                <p>The first thing I did to ensure I had superb usability in my website was to create a site map showing all the essential and relevant elements contained in my newsletter. This allowed me to also have a better idea of how to build the HTML, isolate important parts from my website, and make sure they were linked correctly and that the user didn't do more than two clicks to get to their desired destination.</p>
                <p>Another fundamental aspect was that I needed to ensure my website render was homogenous across platforms and devices. This meant that I needed to make my website responsive and test it in different resolutions, from mobile to regular desktop, and I also tried it in tablet resolution. It seems I successfully adapted this due to the simplicity of my design.</p>
            <h1>Learning</h1>
                <p>While making my website, I had difficulty remembering every single tag I had learned during the course, so I was leveraging w3schools.com for documentation purposes. Another website I used was freecodeCamp.org, which is rich with resources and ideas to help you get your website to fruition. I avoided copy/pasting code that wasn't mine as much as possible, and in most situations, I started with the primary tag from w3schools. I would read what parameters and values each one would take, and from there, I would begin experimenting, achieving the current look and feel of my website.</p>
                <p>During this process, I read over, and over the code I just did. I wanted to make sure it made sense semantically and would be built correctly. One of my priorities was to make this website very accessible, so I was constantly reading the documentation on how to do this better.</p>
                <p>While building my website, one of the challenges was ensuring I was not infringing on copyrights. So, I needed to use royalty-free and open-source images. This is how I stumbled upon wordpress.org/openverse, which has a massive selection of images you can use in your website by providing credit. That's what I did in my slideshow. The other graphics were created by me using a secure software called canvas.com. It helped me speed up this process since I wanted an aesthetically pleasing website.</p>
            <h1>Evaluation I</h1>
            <h2>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? </h2>
                <p>I think that by keeping it simple, I could isolate sections more quickly without messing with my tags. This allowed me to build over a strong foundation, increasing the complexity of my website but still keeping things very clean. It also was a good idea that I decided to pick a more general audience than isolate it to Women. This was helpful because there were not many resources or information about women in engineering; therefore, it would have been harder to develop. Another good aspect was that I decided to get afraid and push my limits. I end up learning so many more things than I was expecting and I plan to implement them soon in my future work.</p>
            <h1>Evaluation II</h1>
            <h2>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently 
            another time? </h2>
            <p>I should have started sooner to plan my website since I didn't expect it to be so time-consuming. I wish I had a better plan to manage my time. Since I have a full-time job and go to school full time, it was pretty challenging to get this done up to the deadline. I also wish I dared to push my limits and try to implement a mustache with handlebars.js, but I was too short in time. I think I'm going to give it a try on my own soon. Also, adjusting YouTube video iframes was a nightmare. I wish I could have done that much better.</p>
            <h3>Resources</h3>
            <p>What resources were used when creating your work? You should list here any sources of
            information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should
            also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts. </p>
            <p>wordpress.org/openverse</p>
            <p>w3schools.com</p>
            <p>canva.com</p>
            <p>fonts.google.com</p>
            <p>font-awesome.com</p>
            <p>Krita & Inkspace for Image Editing</p>
            <p>developer.mozilla.org</p>
